# Business Card Translator
Executable python script that translates input fields from Otsuka business cards from English to Japanese.
Takes in a CSV file as input and outputs a translated version of that file.

Input CSV works with both formats of Otsuka business cards.
For Contractor/Sales/Standard: all 4 fields will have values.
For PEL: all fields except "division" will have values.
